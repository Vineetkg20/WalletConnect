# Wallet Connect Project

This repository is dedicated to the development of a project using **Wallet Connect**, a protocol that allows decentralized applications (dApps) to connect with mobile wallets, enabling secure and easy transactions for users.

## Overview

**Wallet Connect** is a protocol that facilitates the secure connection between dApps and mobile wallets. This project aims to implement Wallet Connect functionality, allowing users to interact with dApps directly from their mobile wallets.

## Features

- **Secure Connections**: Establish secure connections between dApps and mobile wallets.
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Interact with various blockchain networks through compatible wallets.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive interface for users to connect their wallets with minimal effort.
- **Transaction Management**: Users can manage and confirm transactions directly from their wallets.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following:

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: This is usually bundled with Node.js, but you can check by running:
  ```bash
  npm -v
  ```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/wallet-connect-project.git
   cd wallet-connect-project
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Project**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Usage

1. **Connect Your Wallet**:
   - On the front end, provide an option for users to connect their wallets using Wallet Connect.
   - Use the Wallet Connect SDK to handle wallet connections.

2. **Sign Transactions**:
   - Implement functionality to sign transactions and send them to the blockchain directly from the user’s wallet.

3. **Listen for Events**:
   - Utilize event listeners to track the connection status and any incoming transactions.

### Example Code

Here’s a basic example of how to set up Wallet Connect in your dApp:

```javascript
import WalletConnectProvider from "@walletconnect/web3-provider";
import { ethers } from "ethers";

// Create a WalletConnect Provider
const provider = new WalletConnectProvider({
  infuraId: "YOUR_INFURA_ID", // Required
});

// Enable session (triggers QR Code modal)
await provider.enable();

// Create an ethers.js provider
const web3Provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(provider);

// Now you can interact with the blockchain
const signer = web3Provider.getSigner();
const address = await signer.getAddress();
console.log("Connected wallet address:", address);
```
